Program created: 
December 2012

Information:
This is a basic BlackJack program, written in Python.  In BlackJack, the goal is to have your cards add up to, but not exceed, 21.  Each card has a value: 10, Jack, Queen, and King all equal 10; Ace is either valued at 1 or 11, depending on what would be the best value for your (or the dealer's) hand; every other card is the same value as the number is equals (3 has a point value of 3).  For a full description of how to play, visit http://www.blackjackinfo.com.

Goals:
I still have a long way to go on this project.  A few of my goals are as follows:
- Implement a betting system
- Make it so that the value of a previously drawn Ace can be changed mid-hand
- Make it so that a deal can be split when two cards of value 10 are drawn initially

If you have any suggestions, or recommendations, for features/code, please feel free to send an email.

Thanks!
